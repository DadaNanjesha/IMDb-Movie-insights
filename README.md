## 🔍 Overview

In this project, we perform an in-depth exploratory data analysis on a dataset of movies. Using Python and Jupyter Notebook, we clean, visualize, and analyze the data to reveal trends and patterns that are relevant to the film industry. The insights generated from this analysis can be used to understand what makes a movie successful and how different factors—such as genre, runtime, and ratings—impact audience reception.
